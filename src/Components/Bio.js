            <b>Hello! I'm Tenzin Thinley</b>. Frontend developer from India.
            <p>
              A self-taught developer who happens to have a masters in physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expertise lies in <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>,{" "}
              <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>, but I'm always eager to learn new
              things and expand my skillset.
            </p>
            I take pride in my professional attitude and strong work ethic, and
            I'm constantly striving to utilize all of the academic and
            non-academic experiences I've gained along the way.
            <p>
              I believe that being an asset to a company means more than just
              having technical skills, it means being a team player, a problem
              solver, and someone who's always looking for ways to improve.{" "}
            </p>
            So if you're looking for a frontend developer who's both quirky and
            competent, look no further!
